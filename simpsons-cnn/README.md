# Simpsons CNN Classifier 🧠📺

This mini-project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify characters from *The Simpsons* based on images.

## 🗂️ Dataset
Images of characters from *The Simpsons*, ideally preprocessed and split into folders or labeled appropriately.

## 🧠 Model
A simple CNN built using Keras, trained to classify key characters.

## 🧪 Goals
- Practice CNN architecture design
- Use image preprocessing techniques
- Evaluate accuracy with confusion matrix, sample predictions, etc.

## 🚀 To Run
1. Install required packages (TensorFlow, NumPy, etc.)
2. Run `simpsons_cnn.ipynb`

## 📸 Example
> _(Coming soon: sample predictions and confusion matrix)_
